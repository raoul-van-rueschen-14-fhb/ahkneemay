# ahkneemay [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raoul-van-rueschen-14-fhb/ahkneemay.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/raoul-van-rueschen-14-fhb/ahkneemay)

A web server that keeps track of your watched animes by storing information in the cloud. This project relies on the Amazon Web Services EC2, DynamoDB and S3-Buckets.

## Running the Server

Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) first! Download this project, open the terminal or command line and navigate to the project's root directory. Then fetch dependencies with:

```javascript
npm install
```

Since this application relies on AWS, you'll have to provide your credentials as _aws.json_. You can find an example in the _config_ folder. You may then start the server with:

```javascript
node index.js
```

The server will listen on port 8080. If you wish to run this project behind a proxy, you'll have to [configure Node manually](http://jjasonclark.com/how-to-setup-node-behind-web-proxy).
